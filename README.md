Objective:

What I Did:
As a data analyst, I conducted a thorough analysis of historical data, focusing on key metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, occupancy, ADR, Realization, DSRN and average rating. The findings led to the identification of areas for improvement, particularly in implementing dynamic pricing to optimize revenue. Additionally, a targeted promotion strategy for direct channels was recommended to reduce reliance on third-party platforms and increase profitability. By identifying correlation between the lowest occupancy hotel and low average ratings, recommendations were provided to address specific issues in this hotel, aiming to disproportionately improve overall occupancy and revenue.

Conclusion: 
In Conclusion, my role involved analyzing data to uncover revenue opportunities, formulating strategic insights, and providing actionable recommendations to enhance Atliq Grands' competitiveness in the luxury/business hotel market.Domain: Hospitality Function: Revenue Objective: The objective of the project was to revitalize Atliq Grands market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment by leveraging Business and Data Intelligence.
